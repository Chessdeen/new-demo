# What is LAP Application

As a means of reaching farmers en masse,

Lagos state ministry of agriculture needed a means of reaching out to the farmers for the purpose of offering them grants and loans.

## What it does 

I created a platform where farmers could apply for either a grant or loan, submit their data to a database that connects them with the right financial institution for the purpose of a better harvest.

The farmers are to pass an aptitude test after the application, so as to select the right applicants for the financial aid.

## Admin Dashboard

1. Create and manage examiner
2. Examiner can set questions and select applicants who will have access to the test.
3. Set timer for applicants to take test.
4. Manage user data.
